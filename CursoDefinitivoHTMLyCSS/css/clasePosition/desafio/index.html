                She is a prodigious young witch who attends Hexside School of Magic and Demonics. Although she
                was originally depicted as an antagonist, after bonding with Luz, Amity has become a better 
                person, being able to stand up to her parents, regain her friendship with Willow, and become 
                good friends with Luz, later her girlfriend.
